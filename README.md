# AccConExp
## **The quality of a scientific manuscript given by a peer-reviewed report in three dimensions: Accessibility, Contribution and Experimentation**
##Notebooks
In the jupyter-notebooks folder, there are two notebooks:
* PLSSEM_AccConExp contains the code to obtain the PLS-SEM model, validation and analysis.
* AccConExp describes training a multi-task deep learning machine to characterize the report's sentence by Accessibility, Contribution, Experimentation and the corresponding sentiment. Four-second deep learning machines allow us to characterize the sentences by aspect categories (clarity, soundness, originality, motivation, substance, meaningful comparison).

## Datasets
#### Dataset for PLS-SEM part
* The dataset needed to build the PLS-SEM model is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pZNhjlFV7QmXlf7tTtajzJBusm9ZlII0/view?usp=sharing)
#### Dataset for deep learning machines
* The dataset with the review, construct categories, aspect categories, and the corresponding sentiment can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZKAAqKyaHHA_7qk6_XZ9FGLVJZDOxSob/view?usp=sharing)
